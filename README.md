# fmp-design (Jekyll experiment)

This site is designed to help Front End Designers at Findmypast work on our range of projects collaboratively and effectively. When dipping in and out of various projects it really helps to follow standards and conventions to make sure if someone else picks up something youâ€™ve worked on it makes sense. It also helps streamline delivery and ensures consistency around the site.

This site is where we attempt to define those standards! We have a way to go before things are perfect but this is a good place to start. If you want to get involved or suggest updates and changes then by all means get creating some pull requests!
